      "As I came across Facebook, where individuals produce content and communicate in both directions while using web services, and services that are more comfortable than existing logins such as social logins, I became interested in this field, and learned state-funded Java Spring FullStec as my first coding. When I first encountered web development, I felt that the front end that gives users a direct experience depending on how I write the code was right for me.",
      "After graduation, after deciding to become a front-end developer, I completed a 12-week front-end boot camp code camp using the latest technology stack, including React Hooks. (2022. 03. 14 ~ 2022. 06. 03)",
      "After completion, I am in charge of the front-end of the 'Papaya Play' platform at a company called VertigoGames."
